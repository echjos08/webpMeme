##Introduction by Joseph:

	Throughout my academic career in SUNY New Paltz (coming in as a freshman), I’ve started learning Java my first semester in Foundations with Dos Reis. 
    Since then, I’ve taken almost all of the computer science classes that I could fit in my schedule: Web Page Design, Visual Programming, Programming for Media, CPS I, II, and III, Assembly and OOP. 
    Through these classes, I’ve managed to learn Java and messed around with C++, HTML, CSS, and (some) JavaScript and MySQL. 

	In this class, I’d like to learn how to use my previous knowledge of Java and other languages and apply it to real-life programs, applications, and systems that can help solve problems and make the lives of people easier. 
    I’d like to feel somewhat ready and confident to enter the job force. I’d like to learn how to think like a programmer and be able to adjust with diverse situations/problems that I may encounter throughout my career. 
    Overall, I’d like to be (somewhat) prepared for the unknown future of different languages and frameworks and be able to adapt as technology and innovation continues to advance.
